## Core Components

### 1. Service Emulator

The Service Emulator is responsible for mimicking various network services:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Service Emulator] --> B[FTP Service]
    A --> C[SSH Service]
    A --> D[HTTP Service]
    A --> E[Custom Services]
    
    B --> F[Port 21]
    C --> G[Port 22]
    D --> H[Port 80/443]
    E --> I[Dynamic Ports]
```

#### Implementation Details
- Dynamic port binding
- Protocol-specific response handling
- Service behavior customization

### 2. Deception Engine

The Deception Engine manages the honeypot's response strategies:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Deception Engine] --> B[Service Templates]
    A --> C[Response Generator]
    A --> D[Vulnerability Emulator]
    
    B --> E[Configuration]
    C --> F[Dynamic Responses]
    D --> G[CVE Database]
```

#### Key Features
- Dynamic response generation
- Vulnerability simulation
- Attack surface randomization

### 3. Behavioral Analysis

The system uses various metrics to analyze attacker behavior:

```mermaid
pie title Attack Pattern Distribution
    "Reconnaissance" : 40
    "Exploitation Attempts" : 30
    "Data Exfiltration" : 20
    "Other" : 10
```

## Machine Learning Implementation

### Model Architecture

The reinforcement learning model uses the following structure:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Input Layer] --> B[LSTM Layer]
    B --> C[Dense Layer]
    C --> D[Output Layer]
    
    E[State] --> A
    F[Action Space] --> D
    G[Reward Function] --> D
```

### Training Process
1. **Data Collection**
   - Connection patterns
   - Command sequences
   - Timing analysis

2. **Feature Engineering**
   ```python
   features = {
       'timing_patterns': [...],
       'command_sequences': [...],
       'connection_behavior': [...]
   }
   ```

3. **Model Training**
   - Supervised pre-training
   - Reinforcement learning fine-tuning
   - Continuous adaptation

## Security Measures

### Isolation Mechanisms
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Host System] --> B[Docker Container]
    B --> C[Honeypot Service]
    B --> D[Resource Limits]
    B --> E[Network Isolation]
```

### Data Protection
- Encrypted logging
- Secure storage
- Access control

## Performance Analysis

    x-axis [0, 50, 100, 150, 200]
    y-axis "Response Time (ms)" 0 --> 500
    line [100, 150, 200, 180, 160]
```

### Attack Detection Rate
```mermaid
pie title Attack Detection Success Rate
    "True Positives" : 75
    "False Positives" : 15
    "False Negatives" : 10
```
